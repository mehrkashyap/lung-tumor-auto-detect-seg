# Lung Tumor Automated Detection and Segmentation

This repository contains the code for developing and evaluating a deep learning-based 3D U-Net multi-resolution ensemble model for detecting and segmenting lung tumors in CT scans. The primary resources shared include:

1. A web application designed for reviewing ground truth lung tumor segmentations derived from clinical radiation oncology contours
2. Code for the pipeline to train and evaluate the ensemble deep learning model

## Web Application for Review of Clinical Radiation Oncology Contours

The web application is an interactive platform to review ground truth lung tumor segmentations obtained from clinical radiation oncology contours. This was used to develop the primary dataset for training our lung tumor segmentation model.
